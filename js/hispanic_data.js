// Hispanic population percentage by county
//
// This file is automatically generated from the provided CSV
// (Financial Calculators - Sheet9_with_hispanic.csv).  It maps each
// US state (by postal code) to an object whose keys are county
// names (including the "County" suffix) and values are the
// percentage of the county’s population that identifies as
// Hispanic/Latino.  The values are stored as numbers so that
// formatting (e.g. rounding and adding the percent sign) can be
// handled in the content script.  Counties for which no data was
// available in the source file are omitted.
